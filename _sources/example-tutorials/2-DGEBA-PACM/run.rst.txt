.. _dgeba_run:

Running the Build
=================

Now, in our working directory ``my_dgeba_pacm/4-pacm-dgeba-epoxy-thermoset/``, if you haven't already, go ahead and launch via ``./run.sh``.

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./run.sh

As the two ``htpolynet run`` commands indicate, standard output is being redirected from the console to the file ``lo.log`` for the low-cure run and ``hi.log`` for the high-cure run.  Let's consider the contents of ``lo.log`` and then examine the project directory that was created.
