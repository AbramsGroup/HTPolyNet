Usage
-----

Installation of the ``HTPolyNet`` package gives access to the ``htpolynet`` command.  Invoking ``htpolynet --help`` shows basic usage of the command.  Normal usage requires issuing a *subcommand*:

.. code-block:: console

    $ htpolynet <subcommand> <subcommand-arguments>

The following subcommands are available:

================= ========================
Subcommand        Description
================= ========================
``run``           Perform a polymerization or a "build a project"
``parameterize``  Perform only a GAFF-parameterization of monomers and oligomers
``info``          Report information about the ``HTPolyNet`` installation
``fetch-example`` Fetches examples provided in the package
``input-check``   Perform some optional basic checks before launching a build
``postsim``       Perform one or more post-build MD simulations
``plots``         Generate plots from output of builds or post-build simulations
``analyze``       Peform ``gmx``-style analyses of trajectories generated by post-build MD simulations
================= ========================

``htpolynet <subcommand> -h`` will provide subcommand-level help. 

The HTPolyNet Directory Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``htpolynet`` command is typically issued inside of a *base* directory.  I organize my simulations so that each particular system composition and cure protocol I am considering goes in its own base, and multiple runs in that base are all just replica simulations for conducting sample averages.  Each such simulation is referred to as a *project* and each has its own project directory generated by ``htpolynet run``.

A base directory can just be an empty directory to start with.  I usually initialize a base directory by giving it a molecule library:

.. code-block:: console

  .
  └── lib
      └── molecules
          ├── inputs
          │   └── STY.mol2
          └── parameterized

``STY.mol2`` is a mol2 file describing styrene in this example.  ``HTPolyNet`` will store its parameterization information for all molecules and oligomers in the ``parameterized`` subdirectory.

``htpolynet run`` will generate one or more *project* directories in the base directory.  

HTPolyNet Subcommand Summaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``htpolynet run``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

``run`` is used to generate a polymerized system ("build a project") given directives in the configuration file and any required input monomer structures.

.. code-block:: console

  $ htpolynet run <config> [-lib <lib>] [-proj <projname>] \
      [-diag <diagfile>] [--loglevel LOGLEVEL] [--restart] \
      [--force-parameterization] [--force-checkin]

* ``<config>`` refers to the name of the :ref:`configuration input file <configuration_files>`.
* ``-lib`` names a directory that is treated as a local library of molecular structures.  By default, this is assumed to be ``./lib/`` (that is, the directory you are in when you issue ``htpolynet run`` is expected by default to have a ``lib/`` directory; if not, the ``Library`` subpackage of the ``HTPolyNet`` package will be queried for any data).  At the beginning of a new run, ``lib/`` should have one subdirectory called ``molecules``.  Under ``molecules`` should be the two directories ``inputs`` and ``parameterized``.  ``HTPolyNet`` will look for input ``mol2`` or ``pdb`` files in ``lib/molecules/inputs``, and "check-in" the results of parameterized molecules (i.e., Gromacs format ``gro``, ``itp``, and ``top`` files) in ``lib/molecules/parameterized``.
* ``-proj`` names the project directory.  If not specified, or provided with the value ``next`` (the default), ``HTPolyNet`` will create the next auto-named project directory.  These are always named as ``proj-0``, ``proj-1``, ``proj-2``, etc. If no project directory exists and an explicit one is not specified by ``-proj``, ``HTPolyNet`` creates the first one, ``proj-0``:

  .. code-block:: console
    
    .
    ├── lib
    │   └── molecules
    │       ├── inputs
    │       │   └── STY.mol2
    │       └── parameterized
    │
    └── proj-0
        ├── molecules
        │   └── parameterized
        ├── plots
        └── systems

The subdirectories of a project directory upon its creation are as follows.

  * ``molecules/parameterized`` -- all molecular parameterization results appear here (in addition to being checked in to the library)
  * ``systems`` -- system initializations, equilibrations, CURE iterations, and postcure equilibrations all get their own subdirectories here.
  * ``plots`` -- various plots generated on the fly.

These will be explained more fully in the tutorials.

* ``-diag`` names the diagnostic output file, and ``--loglevel`` specifies the logging level it uses.  The default level is ``debug`` (i.e., the most informative).
* ``-restart`` indicates that this is a restart (experimental!).
* ``--force-parameterization`` signals that ``HTPolyNet`` should perform all molecular parameterizations from scratch even if parameterizations exist in the library.
* ``--force-checkin`` signals that any parameterizations ``HTPolyNet`` performs should have their results "checked-in" to the library, even if previous parameterizations are there already.

``htpolynet parameterize``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

``parameterize`` is the command for only performing molecular parameterizations and checking the results into a library:

.. code-block:: console

  $ htpolynet parameterize [-h] [-lib LIB] [-diag DIAG] [-restart] \
    [--force-parameterization] [--force-checkin] [--loglevel LOGLEVEL] config

The command-line options of ``htpolynet parameterize`` have all the same meanings as they do for ``htpolynet run``.  The only difference is that ``htpolynet parameterize`` **only** performs the parameterization of all monomers and oligomer templates.  The intention is that later invocations of ``htpolynet run`` can use these parameterizations without having to reperform them.  Of course, since a first invocation of ``htpolynet run`` also peforms parameterizations and saves their results, it is strictly **never** necessary to use ``htpolynet parameterize``.  However, if your parameterizations have issues, it is cleaner to use ``htpolynet parameterize`` to try to fix them.

``htpolynet info``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This simply outputs some information about ``HTPolyNet``.

.. code-block:: console

  $ htpolynet info
  This is some information on your installed version of HTPolyNet
  System library is /home/cfa/Git/HTPolyNet/Library
  Ambertools:
   antechamber (ver. 22.0) at antechamber                                       
         tleap (ver. 22.0) at tleap                                             
      parmchk2 (ver. 22.0) at parmchk2 

``htpolynet info`` only reports the absolute pathname of the ``Library`` subpackage for your reference, and the fully resolved command names for the three required Ambertools executables ``antechamber``, ``tleap`` and ``parmchk2``, along with their versions.  If they are already in your path, the results appear as above. 

``htpolynet plots``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If invoked inside of a base directory containing one or more project directories, ``plots`` instructs ``HTPolyNet`` to generate some plots.

.. code-block:: console

  $ htpolynet plots --help
  usage: htpolynet plots [-h] [--diags DIAGS [DIAGS ...]] [--proj PROJ [PROJ ...]] \
         [--cfg CFG [CFG ...]] [--buildplot {t,g,n,c} [{t,g,n,c} ...]] \
         [--traces {t,d,p} [{t,d,p} ...]] [--n_points N_POINTS N_POINTS] \
         [--plotfile PLOTFILE] [--no-banner] [--loglevel LOGLEVEL] \
         {diag,build,post}

  positional arguments:
    {diag,build,post}     source of data to plot
                          "diag" takes data from any diagnostic output
                          "build" takes data the console output
                          "post" uses a ``postsim`` configuration file

  options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --diags DIAGS [DIAGS ...]
                          names of diagnostic log files (1 or more)
    --proj PROJ [PROJ ...]
                          name of project director[y/ies]
    --cfg CFG [CFG ...]   name input config files
    --buildplot {t,g,n,c} [{t,g,n,c} ...]
                          type of build plot to generate: t: traces (select using --traces); g: 2-D graph
                          representations iteration by iteration; n: homo-N between crosslinks; c: cluster-size
                          distributions
    --traces {t,d,p} [{t,d,p} ...]
                          type of traces to plot from build: t: temperature; d: density; p: potential energy
    --n_points N_POINTS N_POINTS
                          number of [cold-side,hot-side] data points in the Tg analysis to fit lines to
    --plotfile PLOTFILE   name of plot file to generate
    --no-banner           turn off the banner
    --loglevel LOGLEVEL   Log level for messages written to diagnostic log (debug|info)

The ``plots`` subcommand manages plot generation from data from any of three sources: diagnostics, build, or post-build MD simulations.  (Post-build MD simulations are described below for the ``htpolynet postsim`` subcommand.)  We demonstrate examples of all three types in the tutorials.

``htpolynet fetch-example``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This will fetch one or more examples from the ``example_depot`` of the system ``Library``.

.. code-block:: console

  $ htpolynet fetch-example --help
  usage: htpolynet fetch-example [-h] [-n {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,all}] [-k]

  options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -n {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,all}
                          number of example tarball to unpack from 0-liquid-styrene, 1-polystyrene,
                          2-polymethylstyrene, 3-bisgma-styrene-thermoset, 4-pacm-dgeba-epoxy-thermoset, 
                          5-dfda-fde-epoxy-thermoset,
                          6-htpb-ipdi
    -k                    keep tarballs

Fetching will copy the tarball for the requested system to the current directory and then untar it and remove it, leaving behind the directory.  For example to fetch the PACM-DGEBA epoxy thermoset example:

.. code-block:: console

  $ htpolynet fetch-example -n 4
  $ ls
  4-pacm-dgeba-epoxy-thermoset/
  $ cd 4-pacm-dgeba-epoxy-thermoset
  $ ls
  DGE-PAC-hi.yaml  DGE-PAC-lo.yaml  lib/  run.sh

This folder (like all example folders) comes with two configuration files that differ only the the requested degree of cure.  "hi" refers to 95\% cure, and "lo" to 50\%.  Also provided is the ``./lib/molecules`` folders with the ``./lib/molecules/inputs`` and ``./lib/molecules/parameterized`` empty subfolders.  Finally, the bash script ``run.sh`` can just be invoked to build the input monomers and run the two builds in series.  This will be described in much more detail in the tutorials.

``htpolynet fetch-example -n all`` just grabs all seven examples.

``htpolynet input-check``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The purpose of this subcommand is to report the size of the initial system that *would* be created by the provided configuration file and monomer input structures.

.. code-block:: console

  $ htpolynet input-check DGE-PAC-hi.yaml
  Molecule DGE: 53 atoms, 200 molecules
  Molecule PAC: 41 atoms, 100 molecules
  DGE-PAC-hi.yaml: 14700 atoms in initial system

``htpolynet postsim``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The purpose of the ``postsim`` subcommand is to control the execution of several types of post-build MD simulations.

.. code-block:: console

  $ htpolynet postsim -h
  usage: htpolynet postsim [-h] [-proj PROJ [PROJ ...]] [-lib LIB] \
         [-ocfg OCFG] [-cfg CFG] [--no-banner] [--loglevel LOGLEVEL]  

  options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -proj PROJ [PROJ ...]
                          name of project directory
    -lib LIB              local user library of molecular structures and parameterizations
    -ocfg OCFG            original HTPolyNet config file used to generate project(s)
    -cfg CFG              config file for specifying the MD simulations to perform
    --no-banner           turn off the banner
    --loglevel LOGLEVEL   Log level for messages written to diagnostic log (debug|info)

The simulations are controlled by the YAML-format config file, which is _distinct_ from the cfg file used to generate the project(s).  The types of post-build MD simulations available are annealing, equilibration, temperature-ladder, and uniaxial deformation.  Demonstrations of how the ladder and deformation simulations are used to compute the glass-transition temperature and Young's modulus are detailed in the tutorials.

``htpolynet analyze``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The ``analyze`` subcommand provides a shortcut interfaces to selected ``gmx``-style trajectory analysis calculations.

.. code-block:: console

  usage: htpolynet analyze [-h] [-proj PROJ [PROJ ...]] [-lib LIB] [-ocfg OCFG] [-cfg CFG] [--no-banner] [--loglevel LOGLEVEL]

  options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -proj PROJ [PROJ ...]
                          name of project directory
    -lib LIB              local user library of molecular structures and parameterizations
    -ocfg OCFG            original HTPolyNet config file used to generate project(s)
    -cfg CFG              config file for specifying the analyses to perform
    --no-banner           turn off the banner
    --loglevel LOGLEVEL   Log level for messages written to diagnostic log (debug|info)

The arguments of ``analyze`` are similar to those of ``postsim``, except the configuration file specifies the analysis to perform, and the ``-proj`` specifies which project directories to perform the analysis in.  We demonstrate using ``htpolynet analyze`` in the tutorials.
