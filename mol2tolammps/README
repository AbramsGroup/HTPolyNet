1. mol2lammps.sh is a bash script that automates the creation of the LAMMPS datafile from mol2. 
Script should be executed. charge skip option can be used to avoid charge calculation delay.

antechamber to obtain charges
parmchk2 to obtain GAFF parameters
tleap to obtain AMBER crd and top files
amber2lammps.py3 to convert AMBER files to LAMMPS Data

2. amber2lammps.py3 has been obtained from the LAMMPS distribution and then modified. antechamber is 
supposed to produce integer charges. This script distributes the residual to all atoms. Then, any 
further residual due to roundoff issues is added to index 0. Please check if this is acceptable

Other than the Data file, produces a file with the shake command to be used for LAMMPS, and an index 
with AMBER and LAMMPS atom types.
