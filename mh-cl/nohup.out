Containing 77 atoms in 1 residue
Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Containing 7700 atoms in 100 residues
Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Containing 19500 atoms in 200 residues
Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

NOTE: 14 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      6 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

GROMACS:      gmx grompp, VERSION 5.0.7
Executable:   /usr/local/gromacs/bin/gmx
Library dir:  /usr/local/gromacs/share/gromacs/top
Command line:
  gmx grompp -f npt-init.mdp -c min-1.gro -p init.top -o npt-init -maxwarn 2


NOTE 1 [file npt-init.mdp, line 55]:
  npt-init.mdp did not specify a value for the .mdp option "cutoff-scheme".
  Probably it was first intended for use with GROMACS before 4.6. In 4.6,
  the Verlet scheme was introduced, but the group scheme was still the
  default. The default is now the Verlet scheme, so you will observe
  different behaviour.

Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'title'
Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'optimize_fft'

Back Off! I just backed up mdout.mdp to ./#mdout.mdp.1#

NOTE 2 [file npt-init.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.


NOTE 3 [file npt-init.mdp]:
  nstcomm < nstcalcenergy defeats the purpose of nstcalcenergy, setting
  nstcomm to nstcalcenergy


NOTE 4 [file npt-init.mdp]:
  The Berendsen thermostat does not generate the correct kinetic energy
  distribution. You might want to consider using the V-rescale thermostat.

Setting the LD random seed to 1460774794
Generated 55 of the 55 non-bonded parameter combinations
Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Generated 55 of the 55 1-4 parameter combinations
Excluding 3 bonded neighbours molecule type 'VEA'
Removing all charge groups because cutoff-scheme=Verlet
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 80097.00
Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.52

NOTE 5 [file npt-init.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.
