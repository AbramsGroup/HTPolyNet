Usage
~~~~~

Installation of the HTPolyNet package gives access to the ``htpolynet`` command.  A typical run can be started like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ htpolynet run -cfg <my_config.yaml>

where ``<my_config.yaml>`` is replaced by the name of your input configuration file.  A full listing of command-line parameters can be seen using ``htpolynet -h``.
