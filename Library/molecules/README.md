## Molecular structure data files for molecules

* `inputs/`: `mol2` format molecules created by the user or outside software
* `parameterized/`: `mol2`, `gro`, `itp`, and `top` format molecules generated by `HTPolyNet` via ambertools/parmed from input `mol2`. 

Several file types are represented here:

1. `mol2`  Sybyl MOL2 format files. `inputs/XYZ.mol2` is interpreted as _user input_ describing the atomic structure and topology (bonding information) of the `XYZ` molecule.  Some MOL2 inputs are provided for common monomers.  These files must conform well enough to Sybyl format to permit `antechamber` to read them.  If you create a new molecule to parameterize, you should put its `mol2` file here!  `parameterized/XYZ.mol2` contains output of the parameterization/minimization of the corresponding input.  These represent the coordinates/topologies used for system building.
2. `gro`  Gromacs coordinate files generated automatically.  Usually in the form `XYZ.gro`.
3. `top`/`itp`  Gromacs topology files generated automatically.    Usually in the form `XYZ.top/itp`.
4. `sea` Our custom symmetry-equivalent atom data; congruent to `gro` files, but not included inside `gro` files in order to preserve the `gro` file format.  Symmetry-equivalent atoms in any molecule are detected automatically if molecule names are found in the `use_sea` list of the configuration.
