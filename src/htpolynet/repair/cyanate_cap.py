"""Triazine-to-cyanate-cap postcure repair.

Dismantles every incomplete triazine crosslinker (one with fewer than the
configured ``full_bond_count`` BPA-O bonds) into three independent -C#N
fragments, each then attached either in place (to the BPA-O it was already
bonded to during cure) or to a free, unreacted BPA-OH within
``cap_search_radius``.  Atom conservation is exact: across the whole
system, the count of fragments freed from incomplete rings equals the
count of unreacted BPA-OHs, so every free fragment finds a home.

The surgery is staged so that atom-index references stay valid until the
final batched deletion of sacrificial H atoms; intermediate phases edit
bonds, atom attributes, and residue tags only.
