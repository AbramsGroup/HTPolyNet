# HTPolyNet
> High-Throughput Polymer Network Atomistic Simulations

HTPolyNet is a Python utility for generating atomistic models of cross-linked polymer networks together with appropriate topology and parameter files required for molecular dynamics simulations using Gromacs.  It is intended as a fully automated system builder requiring as inputs only the molecular structures of any monomer species, a description of the polymerization chemistry, and a handful of options describing desired system size and composition.  HTPolyNet uses the Generalized Amber Force Field for atom-typing and parameter generation.

## Installation

The programs ``antechamber``, ``parmchk2`` and ``tleap`` from AmberTools must be in your path.

From PyPI:
```bash
pip install htpolynet
```

From source:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:AbramsGroup/HTPolyNet.git
cd HTPolyNet
pip install -e .
```

Once installed, the user has access to the main `htpolynet` command.
