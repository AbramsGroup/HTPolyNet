# HTPolyNet
> High-Throughput Polymer Network Atomistic Simulations

HTPolyNet is a Python utility for generating atomistic models of cross-linked polymer networks together with appropriate topology and parameter files required for molecular dynamics simulations using Gromacs.  It is intended as a fully automated system builder requiring as inputs only the molecular structures of any monomer species, a description of the polymerization chemistry, and a handful of options describing desired system size and composition.  HTPolyNet uses the Generalized Amber Force Field for atom-typing and parameter generation.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AbramsGroup/HTPolyNet.git
cd HTPolyNet
pip install -e .
```

Once installed, the user has access to the main `htpolynet` command.

## Software Prerequisites

* [AmberTools19](https://ambermd.org/GetAmber.php#ambertools)
  - Options:
     * conda: `conda install -c ambermd ambertools` installs precompiled executables for ambertools into your Anaconda environment
     * compile from source:
       ```
       tar jxf AmberTools20.tar.bz2
       cd amber_src
       ./configure gnu
       source amber.sh
       make install
       ```
  - The specific executables needed are `antechamber`, `parmchk2`, and `tleap`
* [openbabel](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Category:Installation)
    - Options:
       * Install using package manager (Linux)
       * compile from source: (download tar file from the official website)
         ```
         tar zxf openbabel-2.3.2.tar.gz
         cd openbabel-2.3.2
         mkdir build
         cd build
         cmake ..
         make -j4
         make install
         ```
* [gromacs](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2020/install-guide/index.html) v2016
  - Notes for 2016.6 on OpenSUSE Leap 15.2 with cuda 11 and openMPI:
    ```
    tar xfz gromacs-2016.6.tar.gz
    cd gromacs-2016.6
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..  -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON -DREGRESSIONTEST_DOWNLOAD=ON -DGMX_MPI=on -DGMX_GPU=on -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/gromacs-2016.6
    make
    make check
    sudo make install
    ```
    And add to `~/.bashrc`:
    ```
    source /usr/local/gromacs-2016.6/bin/GMXRC
    ```
  
* python3.x

## Usage Example

`htpolynet` should be used inside an initially empty working directory.  

* `htpolynet init` will generate an example configuration file (details on configuration file syntax is below).  

* `htpolynet run <cfgfile>` will run HTPolyNet using the configuration in `<cfgfile>`.

* An HTPolyNet run will generate several subdirectories:

    * `basic/`:  This folder contains two files. 
      - `charges.txt`: Atomic partial charge database; automatically generated by HTPolyNet. 
      
    * `mdp/`: Necessary Gromacs input files for various minimization/MD simulations
      - `em.mdp`: minimization
      - `npt-init.mdp`: initial NPT MD to generate liquid state
      - `npt-sw.mdp`: stepwise NPT MD **to do something, I don't know what**
      - `npt-cl.mdp`: NPT MD in crosslinking algorithm
    * `systems/`: 
      - `unrctSystem`: Raw mol2 files for unreacted monomers and their associated output from `antechamber` and `parmed`.
      - `typeSystem`: Working files resulting from atom charging calculations.
      - `rctSystem`: Structures of reacted oligomers and  and their associated output from `antechamber` and `parmed`.
    * `results/`: Output

## Configuration files

Configuration files for HTPolyNet are simple lines of the form `keyword = value`.  Below are some base-level examples. 

- Basic Information
  ```
  reProject = proj1  # If want to restart a proj folder, add this option otherwise, can 
                      # ignore this option 
  boxSize = 5        # Initial size of the system. If the box is not big enough
  cutoff = 0.5       # Initial cutoff for radius cutoff searching
  bondsRatio = 0.95  # Desired conversion 
  HTProcess = True   # If do the Head-Tail check 
  CPU = 32           # number of CPU used for MD simulation
  trials = 5         # Replica want to generate (Not gurantee all trials will goes to desired conversion)
  ```
- *boxSize*: If the box size is not big enough, not all molecules can be
  inserted to the box which may cause the algorithms cannot
  obtain expected number of molecules and force quit. 
  But if the box size is so large which will delay the 
  performance
  
- Molecules are separeted into two categories, crosslinker and monomer. Each 
  can have multiple molecules. 
  ```
  croName1 = VEA # Name should be consist with the mol2 name 
  ...
  
  croName2 = VEB
  ...
  
  monName1 = STYA
  ...
  
  monName2 = STYB
  
  ...
  ``` 
- Molecules' properties
  ```
  croName1 = VEA
  croNum1 = 4    # number of the molecules
  cro1R_list = C19, C20, C26, C27  # Unique atom names which defined in the mol2 file
  cro1R_rNum = 1, 1, 1, 1          # How many times that each atoms can be reacted
  cro1R_rct = H, T, H, T           # Atoms' head and tail properties 
  cro1R_group = 1, 1, 2, 2         # atoms group on the molecules 
  ```

- Reaction Information:
  Chemical mechanism of the system. In this part, list all potential reactions.
  Don't need to consider the sequence. 'VEA + VEB' is the same as 'VEB + VEA'.
  Add the reactivity probability at the end of each line
  ```
  VEA + VEA + 100.0%
  VEA + VEB + 100.0%
  ...
  ```
