Stereoisomers 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Considering each atom having a unique name and index within a residue, *n* stereo centers results in  2\ :sup:`n`\ unique stereoisomers.  In generating an initial liquid mixture, the number of monomers of a certain type requested is distributed as uniformly as possible among all its stereoisomers (i.e., a racemic mixture is generated by default).  HTPolyNet builds these stereoisomer `*.gro` files automatically, and they are named `MONO-SC-0-0-...-0.gro`, where `MONO` is the original molecule name, `-SC-` indicates sterocenters, and the chain of `0` and `1`s separated by dashes indicate the chirality of each stereocenter.  `0` just refers to the chirality the atom has in the original input `*.mol2` file, and `1` refers to the other chirality.
