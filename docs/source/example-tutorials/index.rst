Example Tutorials
=================

We present here a series of tutorials to help illustrate usage of ``htpolynet``.  Each tutorial walks through one polymerization recipe end-to-end: setting up monomer structures and reactions, running the build with ``htpolynet run``, and then performing post-build MD simulations and analyses with ``htpolynet postsim``, ``plots``, and ``analyze``.  Example ``0`` (liquid styrene) does no polymerization and is the simplest possible build; the remaining examples add cure and cap reactions of increasing complexity, with tutorial ``6`` (BADCy cyanate-ester thermoset) also exercising the new postcure topology-repair stage introduced in htpolynet 2.1.  Each tutorial number matches the example number returned by ``htpolynet fetch-example``.

.. note::

   **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**

   These are *not* production-level builds.  The system sizes are *way too small* and the equilibration and post-build simulation times are *way too short*.  You as a user are responsible for conducting the appropriate finite-size-effect tests and equilibration tests needed to guarantee robustness of your simulations.

.. note::

   **Every example gates its densification on measured density.**  Each one's
   final densification NPT stage carries a ``converge`` block, so instead of
   running for a fixed number of steps it repeats until the density has
   settled -- or reports that it has not.  Wall times below therefore vary
   with how quickly a given box compacts, and a densification stage may run
   two or three times the duration its ``ps`` value suggests.  See
   :ref:`the converge subdirective <configuration_run>` for what the criterion
   is and how to loosen or tighten it.
